Welcome to my homepage! 

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) fortunately under the supervision of Prof. [Yuanyuan Lin](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/ylin/). Also, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Jian Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-huang-jian/) during my Ph.D. studies. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Sichuan University in 2018.

My research interests lie in statistical machine learning and nonparametric statistics, with a focus on the foundations of deep learning including generalization, approximation, and perhaps optimization. Recently, I have been interested in deep reinforcement learning in both theory and application.

Openings are available for undergrad interns/student helpers and research assistants/associates. Feel free to email your CV to me if you are interested in my research.

Recently, I had the honor of receiving the 2024 John Aitchison Prize in Statistics from the Hong Kong Statistical Society (HKSS) in recognition of the excellence of my PhD research in Statistics and deep learning. This achievement is highlighted in the news published by the [Royal Statistical Society (RSS)](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2024/general-news/dr-guohao-shen-wins-2024-john-aitchison-prize-in-s/) and the [Hong Kong Statistical Society (HKSS)](https://www.hkss.org.hk/index.php/events/john-aitchison-prize-in-statistics).
