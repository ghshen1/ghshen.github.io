Hi, welcome to my homepage! 

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). In 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) fortunately under the supervision of Professor [Yuanyuan Lin](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/ylin/). Also, I was fortunate to learn from and work with Professor [Jian Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-huang-jian/) during my Ph.D. study. Prior to my study in Hong Kong, I got my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 2018 from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

My research interests are in general statistical machine learning and nonparametric statistics, including deep nonparametric regressions and classifications, neural network approximation theories and high-dimensional statistics, etc. 

Recently, I have been studying statistical learning theories for deep learning from generalization and appriximation perspetives. I am also interetsed in optimization theories of deep neural networks.
