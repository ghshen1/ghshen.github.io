Welcome to my homepage! 

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). My research interests lie in statistical machine learning and nonparametric statistics, focusing on the foundations of deep learning including generalization, approximation, and perhaps optimization. I have recently been interested in deep reinforcement learning in theory and application.

Openings are available for undergrad interns/student helpers and research assistants/associates. Feel free to email your CV to me if you are interested in my research.

Recently, I received the 2024 John Aitchison Prize in Statistics from the Hong Kong Statistical Society (HKSS) in recognition of the excellence of my PhD research in Statistics and deep learning. This achievement is highlighted in the news published by the [Royal Statistical Society (RSS)](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2024/general-news/dr-guohao-shen-wins-2024-john-aitchison-prize-in-s/) and the [Hong Kong Statistical Society (HKSS)](https://www.hkss.org.hk/index.php/events/john-aitchison-prize-in-statistics).
