Welcome to my homepage! 

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) fortunately under the supervision of Prof. [Yuanyuan Lin](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/ylin/). Also, I was fortunate to work with Professor [Jian Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-huang-jian/) during my Ph.D. studies. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Sichuan University in 2018.

My research interests lie in statistical machine learning and nonparametric statistics, with a focus on the foundations of deep learning including generalization, approximation, and perhaps optimization. Recently, I have been interested in deep reinforcement learning in both theory and practice.

Openings are available for undergrad interns and research assistants/associates. Feel free to email your CV to me if you are interested in my research.
