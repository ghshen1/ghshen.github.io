About me
======
Hi, welcome to my homepage! 

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). In 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) fortunately under the supervision of Professor [Yuanyuan Lin](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/ylin/). Also, I was fortunate to learn from and work with Professor [Jian Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-huang-jian/) during my Ph.D. study. Prior to my study in Hong Kong, I got my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 2018 from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

Recently, I have been studying statistical learning theories for deep learning, including deep nonparametric regressions and classifications. I am also interetsed in approximation and optimization theories of deep neural networks.
